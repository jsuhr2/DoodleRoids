A nice little mash up between Doodle Jump and Astroids, with an 8 bit Iron Man as the playable character (I just saw the new Endgame trailer and got super hype about it, so I figured I had to pay homage somehow). Dragging your finger across the screen moves Iron Man around and tapping fires bombs in the direction of the touch. Eliminating all enemies on the screen reaches a victory scene, while being hit by an enemy or falling through the bottom of the screen issues a loss scene. Hitting an enemy or being hit by an enemy gives an explosion animation. Platforms locations are randomized for each playthrough, so the map is never the same. Platforms also act as barriers, so they can come in handy when getting swarmed. Restarting brings you back to the original scene and restarts the game.
